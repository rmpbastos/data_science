With the myriad of courses, books, and tutorials addressing the subject online, it's perfectly normal to feel overwhelmed with no clue where to start. \n",

        "It is an amazing place to learn and share your experience and data scientists of all levels can benefit from collaboration and interaction with other users. More experienced users can keep up to date with new trends and technologies, while beginners will find a great environment to get started in the field. \n",

        "Kaggle has several [crash courses](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/overview) to help beginners train their skills. There are courses on python, pandas, machine learning, deep learning, only to name a few. As you gain more confidence, you can enter competitions to test your skills. In fact, after a few courses, you will be encouraged to join your first competition.\n",

        "After further studying, you can go back on past projects and try to enhance their performance, using new skills you've learned. To improve this project, we could investigate and treat the outliers more closely, apply a different approach to missing values, or do some feature engineering, for instance.\n",
        "\n",
        "My advice to beginners is to keep it simple when starting out. Instead of aiming at the \"perfect\" model, focus on completing the project, applying your skills correctly, and learning from your mistakes, understanding where and why you messed things up. The data science community is on constant expansion and there's plenty of more experienced folks willing to help on websites like Kaggle or Stack Overflow. Try to learn from their past mistakes as well! With practice and discipline, it's just a matter of time to start building more elaborate projects and climb up the ranking of Kaggle's competitions."
