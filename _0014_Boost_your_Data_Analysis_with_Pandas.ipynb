        "It is built on top of [NumPy](https://numpy.org/) (a Python library for scientific computing) and it has several functions for cleaning, analyzing, and manipulating data, which can help you extract valuable insights about your data set. *Pandas* is great for working with tabular data, as in SQL tables or Excel spreadsheets.\n",
        "\n",
        "The main data structure in *Pandas* is a 2-dimensional table called **DataFrame**. To create a DataFrame, you can import data in several formats, such as *CSV*, *XLSX*, *JSON*, *SQL*, to name a few. With some lines of code, you can add, delete, or edit data in your rows/columns, check your set's statistics, identify and handle missing entries, etc.\n",
        "\n",
        "Besides, as stated above, *Pandas* is widely used and friendly for beginners, which means you'll find a lot of content online about it and it shouldn't be hard to find answers to your questions.  \n",

If you want to run it directly in your machine, you should take a look at [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/), a distribution aimed at scientific computing that comes with hundreds of pre-installed packages. Anaconda can be installed in Windows, macOS, and Linux.\n",
        "\n",
        "However, there is an easier way to get started with *Pandas* through your browser, using a [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/) in the cloud. For instance, you could use [IBM Watson Studio](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/watson-studio) or [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/). Both can be used for free and come with several Python packages pre-installed.\n",
